This project is a simple task manager built with a Vue.js frontend and a Laravel backend.
It demonstrates best practices in  code structure to ensure a maintainable, scalable, and user-friendly experience.

## ðŸŽ¨ UI & UX

- This app focuses on the implementation of the backend so the UI and UX is in simplest state and might not be mobile-friendly 

---

## ðŸ§  Code Implementation Strategy

### âœ… Frontend (Vue 3 + Vite)
- Uses `axios` with a centralized base URL and service abstraction to keep API logic clean.
- State and props are managed cleanly across components, and dynamic UI changes are reactive and predictable.

### âœ… Backend (Laravel 10)
- Follows Laravelâ€™s MVC structure, with clean separation of Controllers, Services, and Routes.
- Uses dependency injection and service classes (e.g. `TaskService`) to keep controllers thin.
- API routes are versioned and follow RESTful best practices.

### âœ… Testing
- Unit testing was not implemented since I focused on the main objective which is the funcationality
